# **Predicting Molecular Solubility Using Regression Models**
This project explores the use of machine learning regression models to predict the solubility of molecules (logS) using chemical descriptors. The dataset is sourced from a public repository and includes descriptors for various molecules.

## **Goals**
- Train and evaluate regression models to predict molecular solubility.
- Compare performance between Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
- Visualize model predictions and fit using matplotlib.

## **Dataset**
The dataset was loaded from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/refs/heads/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv

## **Models Used**
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## **Tools and Libraries**
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- NumPy

## **Results**
Model predictions are visualized using scatter plots, and performance comparison is demonstrated through trend line fitting.
This project was created as an introductory machine learning experiment by Sofia Hernandez, MS student in Artificial Intelligence in Analytics.
